# File_oragnizer

#organizing the file

#logging : It loads a built-in Python tool that lets us record messages instead of using print()
So we can save useful information (time, file name, errors) into a log file and use it later when something breaks.
as python cannot remember where was the file location after it was moved to another destination.

#dry run : before moving the file it show what will happen after the file are move from one destination to another
